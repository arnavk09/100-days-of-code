<p>I have <b>accepted</b> the 100 days of code challenge and I started it on 13 June 2021. My target is to <b><i>learn C++ and Data Structures and Algorithms and to polish my Web Development skills</i></b> as well. The time I've spent in my IDE (VSCode) is being publicly shared keeping in mind public accountability.</p>
